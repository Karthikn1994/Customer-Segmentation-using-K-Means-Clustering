# Customer Segmentation Report — Online Retail

**Deliverable:** Business report summarizing K-Means segmentation and recommendations.  
**Author:** Your Name / Team  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

---

## Executive Summary (TL;DR)
- We segmented customers into **K** groups based on purchasing behavior and demographics to help prioritize retention and growth efforts.
- Key recommended actions: **(1) Reactivation campaigns for churn-risk segment; (2) VIP loyalty program for high-value repeat buyers; (3) Personalized cross-sell offers for frequent low-value buyers.**

---

## Data & Methodology
- **Data used:** Transactional dataset aggregated to customer-level (features created: Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (number of orders), Monetary (total spend), AvgOrderValue, returns_rate, product_category_diversity).
- **Preprocessing:** Missing values imputed with median; numeric features standardized with StandardScaler to ensure equal weighting in distance calculations.
- **Model:** K-Means clustering. Optimal number of clusters selected via the Elbow method (WCSS plot). Final model validated with PCA visualizations and cluster profiling.

## Findings (example format)
> Replace numbers and charts with outputs from your run.

**Cluster 0 — High Value, Low Frequency (HVL):**  
- Size: 12% of customers.  
- Characteristics: Very high average order value and total spend, infrequent purchases, low returns.  
- Business action: Introduce premium loyalty benefits and targeted re‑engagement touchpoints once every quarter.

**Cluster 1 — Frequent Bargain Shoppers (FBS):**  
- Size: 30% of customers.  
- Characteristics: High frequency, low average order value, purchase across discounts and promo categories.  
- Business action: Personalized bundles and subscription offers to increase AOV (average order value), targeted promo-free upsell campaigns.

**Cluster 2 — One-time Buyers (OTB):**  
- Size: 40% of customers.  
- Characteristics: Single purchase, low spend, low diversity of categories.  
- Business action: Welcome series with incentives to bring second purchase within 30 days.

## Visualizations to include in the final slide deck
1. Elbow WCSS plot (explain chosen k).  
2. PCA scatter colored by cluster (show separation).  
3. Bar chart of cluster sizes.  
4. Radar chart or normalized bar chart showing mean feature values per cluster.  
5. Boxplots of Monetary and Frequency by cluster to show spread and outliers.

## Recommendations (Actionable / Prioritized)
1. **Top priority — VIP program** for top 5–10% worth customers (highest lifetime value). Offer early access, free shipping and dedicated support.  
2. **Retention campaigns** for at-risk cluster (recency dropping): 30-day winback emails with tailored discounts.  
3. **Improve average order value** for bargain shoppers through product bundles and targeted cross-sell recommendations.  
4. **Operational changes**: Ensure faster shipping options for high-value customers; monitor returns policy optimisation for specific segments.

## Appendix — Technical notes
- All code saved in `kmeans_clustering.py`. When presenting to stakeholders, include only cleaned visuals and a 4–6 slide summary with recommendations.
- Consider running further analysis (e.g., silhouette scores, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN for non-spherical groups) if clusters overlap significantly.
